### Introduction

Performance optimization is crucial for JavaScript applications, especially for large-scale projects.

### Optimization Techniques

- **Minimize DOM Manipulation**: Batch updates and use `documentFragment`.
- **Debounce and Throttle Events**: Improve efficiency of `scroll`, `resize`, and `input` events.
- **Use Lazy Loading**: Load images and components only when needed.
- **Leverage Web Workers**: Run heavy computations in the background.

### Conclusion

By applying these techniques, you can improve the performance of your JavaScript applications, leading to a smoother user experience.
