### Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that simplifies responsive web design.

### Steps to Create a Responsive UI

1. **Use Flexbox & Grid**: `flex`, `grid`, `justify-center`, and `items-center` help with layout.
2. **Apply Responsive Classes**: Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:` prefixes for different screen sizes.
3. **Optimize Spacing**: Utilize `p-4`, `m-2`, and similar classes for consistent padding and margins.
4. **Dark Mode Support**: Implement `dark:` classes for a modern UI.

### Conclusion

Tailwind CSS speeds up development and ensures a mobile-friendly, visually appealing design with minimal effort.
